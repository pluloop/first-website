            Quick-tempered indeed. When Germany invaded Britain in 1940,
            the British hugely were outnumbered. With their 300 or so 
            Spitfires, however, they were able to shoot down a staggering
            500 enemy aircraft.

            R. J. Mitchell was the designer of the legendary Spitfire.

            flight on the 5th of March, 1936.

            Believe or not, there were a total of 24
            different Spitfires models, or marks. The
            most produced being the Spitfire Mark V 
            with over 6000!
